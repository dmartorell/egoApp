# General Code Style Principles

## Core Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Prefer explicit over implicit when it improves clarity
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and components

## Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Extract magic numbers into named constants
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns (business logic from UI logic)

## Documentation
- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document API endpoints with clear examples
- Keep README and documentation up to date
- Comment the "why" not the "what"
