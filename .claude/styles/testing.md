# Testing Approach

## Testing Philosophy
- Write tests for business logic first
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests when practical
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Keep tests simple and focused

## Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Keep test setup minimal and relevant
- Use proper test data that reflects real scenarios

## React Testing
- Test user interactions, not internal state
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Test accessibility features
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test error boundaries and loading states

## API Testing
- Test all HTTP methods and status codes
- Validate request and response schemas
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test rate limiting and error scenarios
- Use proper test databases (separate from development)

## Test Organization
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use beforeEach and afterEach for setup/cleanup
- Keep tests independent (no shared state)
- Use factories or fixtures for test data
- Maintain test documentation for complex scenarios
