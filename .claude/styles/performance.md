# Performance Guidelines

## General Performance Principles
- Avoid premature optimization
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on user-perceived performance
- Optimize for the critical rendering path

## React Performance
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback judiciously
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons
- Use code splitting with React.lazy for large components
- Optimize re-renders by keeping state local
- Use proper key props to help React's reconciliation

## Bundle Optimization
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement lazy loading for routes and components
- Optimize images with appropriate formats and sizes
- Remove unused dependencies and code
- Use tree shaking effectively

## Data Loading
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use optimistic updates where appropriate
- Debounce user inputs for search and filtering
- Prefetch critical data when possible

## Backend Performance
- Use database indexing appropriately
- Implement connection pooling
- Use caching layers (Redis, memory cache)
- Optimize database queries (avoid N+1 problems)
- Implement proper rate limiting
